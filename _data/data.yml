          - Developed a DEXTF prototype on the Algorand blockchain that resulted in a grant of 150,000 USD.
          - Currently working on various DeFi projects, including the use of the blockchain-independent Reach Dapp language which ensures formal verification of smart contracts. 

      - title: Data Science, Quantitative Finance, And Risk Management 
        link: "#"
        tagline: |
          - Created a model to measure the market risk of a centralized/decentralized exchange 
              with focus on the long/short positions.
          - Experienced risk-management quant with a focus on numerical risk simulations. 
          - Created original quantitative models to numerically compute risk measures, 
              risk contributions, stress tests, sensitivity analysis, and liquidity risk (liquidity score and market impact). 
          - Oversaw the software implementation of quantitative models in software 
              (StatPro Risk Factory) and their link with market data. 
          - Designed and implemented the risk engine currently used by the 
                StatPro analytics (StatPro Risk API used by Revolution). 
          - Created several robot-trading portfolio to take advantage of certain 
                statistical-arbitrage opportunities in the crypto-currency markets.
          - Revised and improved a model for the computation of the time-to-liquidate 
              and the market impact of bonds, in compliance with US regulation. 
          - In the early stages of the COVID19 pandemic, created a model that was 
              able to predicts the early peaks of the virus diffusion in both Singapore and many Italian regions.
          - Created a quantitative model for the distribution of arrivals of restaurant 
              customers by weekday and time, factorizing important independent drivers. 
          - Created a general framework to consistently compute performance and risk contributions. 
                The framework generalizes the standard-market method and provides an elegant split 
                of risk contributions using accounting base, that can be chosen to match the performance contributions, 
                and a statistical base.
          - Created an innovative model to compute the Standard Risk Measure mandatory 
                for superannuation funds in Australia. 
          - Created a market-factor performance contribution model to split portfolio performance 
                in components coming from identifiable market factors (credit, equity, interest rates, and so on).
          - Created a factor risk decomposition method applicable to most type of simulations 
                (Monte Carlo or historical). This method allows the computation of, for example, 
                the risk contribution in a convertible bond attributable to interest rates, credit risk, 
                or equity risk, respectively. The model has been used in production for more than 8 years. 
          - Created a liquidity-risk framework to compute the market bid/ask spread induced by the bid/ask 
                spread of the underlying risk factors.
          - Created a model to simulate the market expectation of credit risk in the historical-simulation 
                method, using the latest credit-default-swap quotes.
          - Created a modification of the Kalotay-Fabozzi model allowing the stability of risk-figures 
                for mortgage-backed securities.
